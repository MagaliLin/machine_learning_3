all_theta is a matrix, where there is a row for each of the trained thetas. In the exercise example, there are 10 rows, of 401 elements each. You know this because that's how all_theta was initialized in line 15 of the script template.

(note that the submit grader's test case doesn't have 401 elements or 10 rows - your function must work for any size data set - so use the "num_labels" variable).

Each call to fmincg() returns a theta vector. Be sure you use the lambda value provided in the function header.

You then need to copy that vector into a row of all_theta.

The oneVsAll.m script template contains several Hints and a code example to guide your work.

The "y == c" statement creates a vector of 0's and 1's for each value of 'c' as you iterate from 1 to num_labels. Those are the effective 'y' values that are used for training to detect each label.

Type these commands in your workspace to see how to copy a vector into a matrix:

The syntax "(2,:)" means "use all columns of the 2nd row".
